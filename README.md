# Impact of COVID-19 on U.S. Financial Markets

## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of various asset metrics due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of the US financial markets. The analysis considers three distinct periods: Pre-COVID, During-COVID, and Post-COVID.

## Asset Classes Analyzed

- Equities (S&P 500)
- Commodities (Crude oil and Gold)
- Currencies (USD/EUR)
- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin)
- Bonds (US Treasury yield - 10-year)

## Objectives

1. **Data Extraction:** Fetch historical price data for the selected assets.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends and derive insights.
4. **Hypothesis Testing:** Test for statistical significance of observed differences in returns, volatility, and correlations.
5. **Predictive Modeling and Volatility Assessment:** Use ARIMA and GARCH models.
6. **Portfolio Strategy Development:** Propose strategies for mitigating systemic risk.
7. **Findings and Recommendations:** Summarize key findings and provide recommendations.
